{"Questions":[{"Question":"The human heart is divided into sections called chambers. How many chambers does a human heart have?","Explanation":"The heart has four chambers: two atria and two ventricles. The right atrium receives oxygen-poor blood from the body and pumps it to the right ventricle. The left atrium receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumps it to the left ventricle. The left ventricle pumps the oxygen-rich blood to the body.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":true,"Answers":[{"Text":"4","Correct":true},{"Text":"5","Correct":false},{"Text":"3","Correct":false},{"Text":"2","Correct":false}]},{"Question":"Some of the heart's chambers are located at the top and some at the bottom. What is the name for the top chambers of the heart?","Explanation":"The two chambers on top are called the atria . If you're talking only about one, call it an atrium. The atria are the chambers that fill with the blood returning to the heart from the body and lungs. The heart has a left atrium and a right atrium.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"Ventricles","Correct":false},{"Text":"Atria","Correct":true},{"Text":"Upstairs chambers","Correct":false},{"Text":"Base chambers","Correct":false}]},{"Question":"What's the name for the bottom chambers of the heart?","Explanation":"The heart has four<b> </b>chambers — two on top and two on bottom: The two bottom chambers are the right ventricle and the left ventricle.

The <b>blood vessels</b> that carry <b>blood</b> away from the <b>heart</b> are called arteries. The ones that carry <b>blood</b> back to the <b>heart</b> are called <b>veins</b>.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"Bronchioles","Correct":false},{"Text":"Arteries","Correct":false},{"Text":"Veins","Correct":true},{"Text":"Capillaries","Correct":false}]},{"Question":"The right side of the heart pumps blood to the lungs. What happens in the lungs?","Explanation":"The right side of your heart receives oxygen-poor blood from your veins and pumps it to your lungs, where it picks up oxygen and gets rid of carbon dioxide. The left side of your heart receives oxygen-rich blood from your lungs and pumps it through your arteries to the rest of your body.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"The blood loses carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen.","Correct":true},{"Text":"Nobody knows for sure.","Correct":false},{"Text":"It has a rest.","Correct":false},{"Text":"The blood turns from red to green.","Correct":false}]},{"Question":"Most of the blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood around the body are called arteries. The largest artery in the body is the aorta.","Explanation":"","Image":"","isToF":true,"ToFAnswer":true,"Answers":[]},{"Question":"Between the upper and lower chambers of the heart are some leaf-like structures which help blood to flow in one direction. These structures are called valves.","Explanation":"","Image":"","isToF":true,"ToFAnswer":true,"Answers":[]},{"Question":"What is the average size of your heart?","Explanation":"An adult heart has a mass of 250–350 grams (9–12 oz). The heart is often described as the size of a fist: 12 cm (5 in) in<b> length</b>, 8 cm (3.5 in) wide, and 6 cm (2.5 in) in thickness, although this description is disputed, as the heart is likely to be slightly larger.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"The size of a pea.","Correct":false},{"Text":"The size of a beach ball.","Correct":false},{"Text":"The size of a watermelon.","Correct":false},{"Text":"The size of your clenched fist.","Correct":true}]},{"Question":"The number of times the heart beats per minute is called the heart rate. All of the following activities would be likely to increase the heart rate except one. Which one?","Explanation":"At rest, the SA node causes your <b>heart</b> to <b>beat</b> about 50 to 100 <b>times</b> each <b>minute</b>. During <b>activity</b> or excitement, your body needs more oxygen-rich blood; the <b>heart rate</b> rises to well over 100 <b>beats per minute</b>.

Blood enters the heart when the muscles of atria relax and it is pumped out when it is contracted.","Image":"","isToF":false,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[{"Text":"atria relax","Correct":true},{"Text":"ventricles contract","Correct":false},{"Text":"ventricles relax","Correct":false},{"Text":"atria contract","Correct":false}]},{"Question":"Human heart is made up of five compartments.","Explanation":"The answer is false. The human heart is made up of four compartments. There are two auricles which are also called as atrium. The atrium receives the deoxygenated blood. There are two ventricles. This deoxygenated blood enters the left atrium and then the ventricles. From the ventricles, the blood moves to lungs for purification and then is supplied to the body.","Image":"","isToF":true,"ToFAnswer":false,"Answers":[]}]}
